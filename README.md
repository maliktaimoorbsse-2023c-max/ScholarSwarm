# ScholarSwarm
### Agentic AI System for Autonomous Academic Research Assistance

## Overview
ScholarSwarm is an AI-driven system designed to automate the process of academic literature reviews. It uses an **Orchestrator-Worker architecture** to coordinate multiple agents for searching, analyzing, and summarizing research papers.

## Features
- **Autonomous Orchestration:** A central Lead Agent decomposes research goals into tasks.
- **Automated Literature Search:** Specialized agents mock API calls to academic databases.
- **Gap Identification:** Analysis agents identify limitations in existing research to suggest new directions.
- **Memory Persistence:** Uses a simulated vector memory to retain context across sessions.

## Software Design
- **Architecture Pattern:** Orchestrator-Worker (Master-Slave).
- **SDLC Model:** Agile.
- **Language:** Python 3.9.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Download `main.py`.
3. Run the command: `python main.py`

## Project Status
This is a semester project for the **Software Design and Architecture (SDA)** course. It includes a functional Python prototype and a thesis-style research report.
